How to contribute
=================

In the file `.tool-versions` you can find required versions of tools we use for development (Node.js for example).
Make sure you use the same version for every tool. Or use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) for it.

We use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org). Please install a plugin for your editor.

We use [Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist). The config placed in `package.json`.
